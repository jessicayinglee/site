Hi, I'm Jess. I currently work in Toronto as a research/data analyst, doing market research on insurance companies in Canada. I graduated with a master's in economics in 2019 from the University of Western Ontario. Ultimately, I hope to pursue a career in academic research in economics; I am primarily interested in studying decision theory, with a secondary interest in public economics.

Outside of economics, I am a classical pianist and completed the Royal Conservatory of Music's Certificate Program---a standard entrance requirement for college music programs---at the age of 12. I also have a knack for memorization, and correctly recited 500 digits of pi at the UWO math club's Pi Day event in 2019.
