Hi, I'm Jess. I currently work in Toronto as a research/data analyst, doing market research on insurance companies in Canada. I graduated with a master's in economics in 2019 and an honors BA in economics in 2018, both from the University of Western Ontario. Ultimately, I hope to pursue a career in academic research in economics. I am primarily interested in studying decision theory, with a secondary interest in public economics.

Outside of economics, I am a classical pianist and completed the Royal Conservatory of Music Certificate Program (entrance requirement for college music programs) at the age of 12. I also have a knack for memorization, and correctly recited 475 digits of pi at the UWO Math Club's Pi Day event in 2019.
