# README



This repository generates my personal website. It is built on GitHub Pages with Jekyll, which is licensed under [MIT](../LICENSE) (c) 2019 GitHub, Inc.

The theme was customized by me, from the Jekyll [minima](https://jekyll.github.io/minima/) theme. My customizations include:
* Improved menu functionality for mobile devices
* Aesthetic changes to style sheets and page layouts
